config UBOOT_DEBUG
	bool "Compile U-Boot for debugging"
	default n
	help
	    This option passes -fno-schedule-insns 
	    and -fno-schedule-insns2 to the GCC in
	    order to prevent a debugger from jumping
	    arround the code when trying to single
	    step. Further it adds -g to the GCC options
	    to add debug symbols to the resulting
	    ELF binary.

config UBOOT_DEBUG_GDB
	bool "Compile U-Boot with special GDB symbols"
	default n
	depends on UBOOT_DEBUG
	help
	    This option passes -ggdb instead of -g to
	    the GCC. This is only usefull if GDB is used
	    for debugging.
